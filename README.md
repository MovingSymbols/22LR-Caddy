# 22LR-Caddy
3D printable caddy for managing 22LR cartridges

This model really only works with the cartridges and inserts found in CCI 50-round boxes.  However, it works REAL good with them.
(https://github.com/MovingSymbols/22LR-Caddy/blob/main/22LR%20Cartridge%20Caddy%20for%20CCI%2050rd.jpg)

The idea is that one slides the 22LR rounds out of the box (they are in a perforated carrier) then lower the cartridges point-down into the caddy.
The carrier plate will snap into the top of the caddy, and each 10 round row of cartridges will be raised up to a different level, making it super-duper easy and convenient to pull cartridges out, even while wearing tac gloves or something.

Especially convenient for competition shooting, and reloading magazines.

Didn't use all fifty rounds?  Just lift it up and out from the retainer clips on the sides, and slide the carrier (still containing the unused rounds) back into the box.

# Printing
Print one each of the body, and the retainer. Print them in the orientation shown (i.e. print the body with the bottom flat on the build platform, and the print the retainer on its side.)  They will print with no supports needed, as long as your printer isn't complete ass, anyway.

# Assembly
Just snap the retainer onto body, it should hold itself in place without glue.

# What About Other Brands (not CCI, etc)?
It probably won't work, and by probably I mean definitely

# Then can yo-
No

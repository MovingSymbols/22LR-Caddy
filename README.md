# 22LR-Caddy
3D printable caddy for managing 22LR cartridges

This model really only works with the cartridges and inserts found in CCI 50-round boxes.  However, it works REAL good with them.

The idea is that one slides the 22LR rounds out of the box (they are in a perforated carrier) then lower the cartridges point-down into the caddy.
The carrier plate will snap into the top of the caddy, and each 10 round row of cartridges will be raised up to a different level, making it super-duper easy and convenient to pull cartridges out, even while wearing tac gloves or something.

Especially convenient for competition shooting, and reloading magazines.

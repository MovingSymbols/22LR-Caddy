# 22LR Printable Caddy (for easier handling and dispensing of 22LR)
3D printable caddy for managing 22LR cartridges

This model really only works with the cartridges and inserts found in CCI 50-round boxes.  However, it works REAL good with them!
I use CCI SV (standard velocity) for target shooting and buy them by the case, so if you do as well then you might be interested in this.

The idea is that one slides the 22LR rounds out of the box (they are in a perforated carrier) then lower the cartridges point-down into the caddy.
The carrier plate will snap into the top of the caddy, and each 10 round row of cartridges will be raised up to a different level, making it super-duper easy and convenient and sexy and fun to pull cartridges out, even while wearing dorky tac gloves or something.  Take the highest row first, then the next, and so on.

Especially convenient for competition shooting, and reloading magazines.

Didn't use all fifty rounds?  Just lift the carrier up and out (unhooking it from the retainer clips on the sides) and slide the carrier -- which still contains the unused rounds -- back into the box.

The normal way to deal yourself 22LR is to open the box, slide out the carrier to expose 10 (or five) rounds, then tip it over into your hand so the cartridges fall out.  So what advantages does using a caddy bring?

- It makes reloading magazines faster and easier, because one isn't going back-and-forth tipping rounds out of a box (which is a two-handed process, doesn't keep the rounds pointed the same way, and is awkward at best if wearing gloves.)  One simply plucks a round at a time, loading mags until done.
- When shooting at events, time and concentration are factors. It is slow and distracting to fiddle with dumping rounds into your palm (which, again, is a two handed process.) It's better to just one-handedly pick & reload from a ready-to-go caddy that is easy to move, carry, and charge.

## Printing
Print one each of the body, and the retainer. Print the parts in the orientation shown. **This is very important.**  
Both parts include roughly 45 degree overhangs, but a printer should be able to handle that fine without needing supports (as long as your printer isn't complete ass, anyway.)

The retainer clip will only be strong in the right places if printed in the orientation shown.  (Why? If you print the retainer clip "standing up" instead of laying down, the layer orientations will make the part very weak in the thin areas.)

## Assembly
Just snap the retainer onto the body, it should hold itself in place without glue.

## What About Other Brands (not CCI, etc)?
It probably won't work, and by probably I mean definitely

## Then can yo-
Nope

## Actually I want to talk business/design/etc
It just so happens I do this kind of thing as a job. Fire me an email, it's in my bio
